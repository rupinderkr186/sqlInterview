# Part 1- Sql(Structured Query Language) Interview Questions & Answers
## 1) What is normalization?  
Normalization is a database design technique to remove redunadant data.
## 2) How to implement normalization?
Normalization is implemented by splitting tables in two, one with reference data(master table) and other with transaction data.

In the above table country name like India, IND is redunadant and we can split this in **2 tables: one as mst_country and other as tblCustomer**. Now we can use country Id from mst_country in tblCustomer to reference countries.

## 3) What is denormalization?  
Denormalization is a database technique to <ins>improve search performance.</ins> In denormalization we merge table so that we need to fetch from less tables and thus increase search performance.In denormalization tables have duplicate data.

## 4) Explain OLTP vs OLAP?
**OLTP** : Online Transaction Processing.Normalization avoids redundancy and we follow normalization design(1st, 2nd and 3rd normal forms).  
**OLAP** : Online Analytical Processing. Denormalization improves search performance and we follow denormalization design.

## 5) Explain 1st, 2nd and 3rd normal form?
**1st normal form** : A table is in first normal form when the columns have <ins>Atomic values</ins>. It should not have <ins>repeating groups</ins>. If the table is not in 1st normal form, it can have <ins>insert, update and delete anamolies</ins>.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8665269-4f00-4b50-b13b-a0900649135a)

**2nd Normal form** : First normal form should be satisfied. All non-key columns should be <ins>fully dependent on the Primary key</ins>. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30db4906-d1c3-4ca1-8fb4-72844c412e56)

**3rd Normal** : All 1st and 2nd normal form should be satisfied. No <ins>transient</ins> dependency should be present.

**Acronym: APT**

## 6) Primary Key vs Unique key ?
Remember the 2 Ns.  
**1st N NULLS** : Unique can have NULLS , but primary key can not have NULLS.  
**2nd N Numbers** : Many unique keys but ony ONE Primary key.  
Both keys dont allow duplicates in tables.

## 7) Differentiate between Char vs Varchar ?
Char is Fixed length while varchar is variable length.

## 8)Differentiate between Char vs NChar ?
If you want to just store english characters then use Char , For multilingual language (Non-English) use NChar.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9175941f-9c18-4306-a8af-eae912d36daa)

## 9) Whats the size of Char vs NChar ?
Char 1 Character = 1 byte , For NChar 1 Character = 2 bytes.  
Here **n** stands for unicode like nchar, nvarchar etc all can store unicode characters and takes 2 bytes for one character

## 10) What is the use of Index ?
Indexes increases search performance. Without index data is searched sequentially and for example if we have numbers 1 to 100 and want to search 52, it will go one by one starting from number 1 and going all the way to 52 and this will take time to search.

## 11) How does index make search faster?
Search becomes faster because of Balance tree structure. Internally it creates Node and Leaf nodes to reach to the data quick.

## 12) Clustered vs Non-Clustered index
In <ins>Clustered index</ins> leaf node will point to <ins>actual data</ins>. While in case of <ins>non-clustered index</ins> leaf node <ins>takes help of clustered index</ins>

## 13) Function vs Stored Procedures
<ins>Function</ins> returns Computed Scalar values. You cannot make permanent changes (insert, update, delete) inside function.  
<ins>Stored procedure</ins> is a mini-programs which can do anything , make changes , backup database.

## 14) What are triggers and why do you need it ?
Triggers are logics which can be executed when events like insert, update, delete etc happens.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e366bb38-9ada-4747-b9a7-86dd289dde66)

## 15) What are types of triggers ?
There are two types After trigger and Instead OF trigger.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89640dfb-ca11-4660-9dc6-955e15efc40e)

## 16) Differentiate between After trigger vs Instead Of ?
<ins>After trigger</ins> : After event has happened logic is executed.
<ins>Instead Of trigger</ins>: Instead of the event the logic is executed.

## 17) What is need of Identity ?
Identity helps to define auto-incremented column.

## 18) Explain transactions and how to implement it ?
Transaction treats series of activity as one single unit. Either everything is successful and or everything rollbacks.

## 19) What are inner joins ?
Inner join selects <ins>matching records</ins> from both tables.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcdcbbf3-5556-4427-acda-24dbf553fb34)

## 20) Explain Left join ?
All data from left table selected and only matching records from right table.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd57aa7d-4a94-41dc-a76a-575c01ccd1b5)

## 21) Explain Right join ?
All data from right table selected and only matching records from left table.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b415e895-ee9c-456c-9bb5-fad87180c31f)

## 22) Explain Full outer joins ?
All matching and unmatching records from both left and right table are selected.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27f9ef71-f25e-49fe-98b4-59a73e608d87)

## 23) Explain Cross joins ?
Cross join is cartesian. Every record of one table is joined with other table records.

# Part 2-Sql(Structured Query Language) Interview Questions & Answers
## 24) Why do we need UNION ?
Union combines two result sets.  
  
select [ProductId], [ProductName] from [LearnSql].[dbo].[mst_Products]  
union  
select [ProductId], [ProductName] from [LearnSql].[dbo].[mst_ExpiredProducts]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81a2a173-c9c7-4e78-8377-4628d3da8616)

## 25) Differentiate between Union vs Union All ?
<ins>Union</ins> combines result sets and <ins>excludes duplicates</ins> while <ins>Union all</ins> also combines result set but <ins>includes duplicates</ins>.  

select [ProductId],[ProductName] from [LearnSql].[dbo].[mst_Products]  
union all  
select [ProductId],[ProductName] from [LearnSql].[dbo].[mst_ExpiredProducts]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80a3b351-7976-4142-986a-4d4ed452812e)

## 26) can we have unequal columns in Union?
No.  

select[ProductName] from [LearnSql].[dbo].[mst_Products]  
union all  
select [ProductId],[ProductName] from [LearnSql].[dbo].[mst_ExpiredProducts]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64f18106-763c-4c05-b70a-7f48e44a6737)

## 27) Can column have different data types in Union ?
No.  

select [ProductName],[ProductId] from [LearnSql].[dbo].[mst_Products]  
union all  
select [ProductId],[ProductName] from [LearnSql].[dbo].[mst_ExpiredProducts]  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84968336-d1d1-4fb1-8110-4921b92ed38d)

## 28) Which Aggregate function have you used ?
Sum,Avg,Max, Min and Count.  

select sum([CustomerAmount]),  
Avg([CustomerAmount]) ,  
min([CustomerAmount]),  
max([CustomerAmount]),  
Count(*)  
from [dbo].[txn_Customer]  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ad181a1-38df-4abe-bc8d-b8287c6002c1)

## 29) When to use Group by ?
It helps to convert rows in to summary rows using common values.  

select [ProductName],sum([CustomerAmount]) from [dbo].[txn_Customer]  
group by [ProductName]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/750ceba9-9913-4961-938a-0877b52a0816)

## 30) Can we select column which is not part of group by ?
No. In a group by you can only select columns which are present in groupby.  

select[CustomerName],[ProductName],sum([CustomerAmount]) from [dbo].[txn_Customer]  
group by [ProductName]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa718293-eaac-40ad-a00a-680a57d4bacb)

## 31) What is having clause ?
Having clause helps to filter group by data.  

select [ProductName],sum([CustomerAmount]) from [dbo].[txn_Customer]  
group by [ProductName]  
having [ProductName]='shoes'  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01adec43-cc4a-4adf-a509-1969d20a20ae)

## 32) Having clause vs Where clause

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76228fb0-0c3d-4614-aa8e-1864baa79c70)

## 33) How can we sort records ?
Sorting is done by using order by clause.  

select * from [dbo].[txn_Customer] **order by** [CustomerAmount] **desc / asc**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e93f0104-dc11-4d09-9e50-0ac542621382)

## 34) Whatâ€™s the default sort ?
Ascending.

## 35) How can we remove duplicates ?
By using Distinct keyword.  

select **distinct** [ProductName] from [dbo].[txn_Customer]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2685c4d8-8da3-4647-92ad-31da4d41c57c)

## 36) Select the first top X records ?
By using the top keyword.  

select **top 2** * from [dbo].[txn_Customer]
